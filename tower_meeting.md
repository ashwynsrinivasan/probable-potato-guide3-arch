- Adding additional metal layers is something
              - n-metal
- heater efficiency is around 17mW for the MA platform and 44mW for the DA platform
              - 
- split matrix needed for the next tapeout
- trench etch for 20um
- forecast roadmap
              - 675 wafers a year
- we need atleast the DAC
- Action item:
              - product intercept for the roadmap and forecast
- Must asks:
              - packaging stresses in the III-V
- Currently we should be PH18DAC
- Technology roadmap
              - Attenuated phase shift recticles ==> 
              - Compatible with features in DAC 
              - standard 200mm etch
                            - depth and CDs
                            - variability data ==> share whatever we can so far
                            - more data towards secondhalf of end of the year ==> same material and same process with the existing designs
                            - repeatability from base process
- short loop processes
              - shifts in the passive devices
              - passive and process variation ==> window studies on the CD of the silicon waveguide
              - close to 50% to the baseline ==> the fill factor is lower than 50%
- LPCVD nitride ==> Ridge nitride 
              - We can use the PH18MA PSR design cell and potentially add it to the DAC paltform
              - Must explore ridge nitride
- Share the coupling to DAC and second nitride
              - Conceived for Lidar application
              - No coupling data shared from OL on the DAC platform
- We do not QA if we use GDS factory
              - need to clsoe this gap internally
- fundamentally ==> electrical testing is only done
              - only doping profiles through the III-Vs
              - basic IV curves also done
              - contact resistances ==> 4p for N and P layer
              - diode-array capacitances for each epi-type 
              - measurements done on 7-reticles
              - failure of 2 sites out of 7 for the acceptance
              - cpk against these numbers will be shared
- PH18DA is in nebulus state of production and prototype ==> according to 
              - currently engineering side
              - intercept 
- List:
              - ellipsometry on SIMS
              - OBR measurements ==> not done as part of our current PCM
- NPI:
              - reliability release document in the next couple of months for the prototype release
- Tower have a 300mm fab at their Japan facility for MA process
              - Current DA fab runs in a 200mm platform
              - They are open to start with 300mm platform and core the wafers to 200mm for DFB gratings in Si
